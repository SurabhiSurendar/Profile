            <h2>Health Camp Management System (HCMS)</h2>
            <h3>Project - Oracle, November 2022 - December 2023</h3>
            <img src="HCMS.png" height="300" width="400">
            <p>The health condition of people living in urban and rural slums is dire due to the absence of nearby hospitals, 
                forcing them to rely solely on health camps. Patient data collected at these camps is currently paper-based and 
                consolidated manually in Excel sheets, hindering the extraction of insights such as disease outbreaks or resource 
                requirements for future camps. Despite support from NGOs, volunteers struggle with data consolidation and tracking 
                of medical equipment, severely impacting their ability to effectively serve the population. The lack of rural 
                statistics exacerbates the gap between the country's health infrastructure and the needs of rural communities.
                <br>
                <br>
                To address these challenges, a simplified application will be developed for efficient collection and management of 
                patient data. This will enable doctors to treat individuals based on their comprehensive health history gathered during 
                health camps. Utilizing data insights and predictive analytics, the application aims to optimize the scheduling and 
                execution of health camps, as well as streamline the delivery and monitoring of medical supplies to targeted regions.
                <br>
                <br>
                Key features of the application will include user-friendly interfaces tailored for easy adoption by field volunteers, 
                ensuring daily operational usability. Data security will be paramount, achieved by eliminating intermediaries from 
                transaction processes.</p>

            <h2>Blockchain based energy transaction in microgrid</h2>
            <h3>IEEE Publication - 2022 IEEE 19th India Council International Conference (INDICON), November 2022</h3>
            <p>This project aims to provide a potential solution of how blockchain facilitates cost reduction when used in micro grids. 
                The energy is transferred from producer to consumer and the additional service charges are eliminated when using the 
                blockchain method. This idea uses a bidding mechanism in the grid so that the producer who gives energy at a minimum 
                cost is automatically mapped to the consumer. The smart contract is included in blockchain shared by the participants 
                and keeps immutable transaction records.</p>
